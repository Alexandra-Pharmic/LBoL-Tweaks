This mod makes the "Artificial Jewelry" cards more usable: it now provides two mana instead of one.

### Why?
The "Jewelry Night Sale" event is generally annoying to get, and buying the Jewelry card fails to be an interesting consideration in most runs - if you're okay with having a junk card, it's better to take the free one. This mod aims to make it more interesting by changing the card into a weak ritual. It's still not a very good card because 1 card for 1 mana is a mediocre trade, but it's way more tolerable if you don't have Tactical Conductor.

This mod buffs the player and is intended for casual runs.
