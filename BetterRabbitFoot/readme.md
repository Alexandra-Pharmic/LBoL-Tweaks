This mod makes the "Lucky Rabbit's Foot" card more usable: it now lets you spend a generic mana to exile it and draw a new card.

### Why?
Taking the Lucky Rabbit's Foot is generally not a very appealing option. It gives you no immediate advantage at a time where you need to be getting stronger, and you end up with a junk card in your deck. You now have the option to spend a mana to get rid of the card during combat if it's problematic. However, this will forfeit the cash bonus for the combat, so you have to decide if it's worth it. 

This mod buffs the player and is intended for casual runs.
