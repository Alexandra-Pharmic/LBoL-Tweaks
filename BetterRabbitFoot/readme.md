This mod makes the "Lucky Rabbit's Foot" card more usable: it now lets you spend a generic mana to exile it and draw a new card.

### Why?
Taking the Lucky Rabbit's Foot is generally not a very appealing option. It gives you no immediate advantage at a time where you need to be getting stronger, and you end up with a junk card in your deck that will make your average draws worse. You now have the option to get rid of the card if it's problematic.

This mod buffs the player and is intended for casual runs.
