This mod changes the color identity of the card "Dark Dancer" from Green/Black to Green/Red.

### Why?
Xeno makes the case for it here: https://discord.com/channels/1040229874176098344/1041404940431675482/1164234626856919110
My favorite point is that Red has more multi-hit attack than Black, which gives it more opportunities to take advantage of it.
