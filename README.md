# LBoL-Tweaks
A folder for mods that tweak certain things about Touhou Lost Branch of Legend. 
They are offered separately so that you can pick and choose which ones you want to play with.

### I don't know how to mod the game!

[Check out Neoshrimp's guide.](https://github.com/Neoshrimp/LBoL-Entity-Sideloader/tree/master)

### Mods that primarily aim to tweak stuff
* GruulDancer: Changes the card "Dark Dancer" from Black/Green to Black/Red.
* WhiteButterfly: Changes the card "Butterfly's Wingbeats" from green to white.

### Mods that buff the player or nerf the enemies

* BetterJewelry: Makes the "Artificial Jewelry" card more usable.
* BetterRabbitFoot: Makes the "Lucky Rabbit's Foot" card less clunky.
