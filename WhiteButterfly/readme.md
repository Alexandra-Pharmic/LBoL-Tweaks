This mod changes the color of the card "Butterfly's Wingbeats" from green to white.

### Why?
"Butterfly's Wingbeats" is a bit awkward in green. Mono-green only has one source of mid-combat upgrades - the -3 of Larva, God of Evernight, a Cirno exclusive. Meanwhile, white has access to Pagoda's Glare, Wandering Heaven, Apotheosis, and the Shining Exhibit Beautiful Plate. I believe this card makes more sense in white than in green.
